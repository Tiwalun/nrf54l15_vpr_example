# Rust on nRF54L15 VPR core
This is an example describing how to run Rust code on the
VPR core of the nRF54L15 microcontroller.

The code assumes use of the nRF54L15 DK.

The application core FW is used to start the VPR core, and
it turns on two leds (LED0 and LED2) for debugging purposes.

The VPR core will turn on LED1.
